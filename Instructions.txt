=== Recommendation =====
1. Reports..you can extract report of individual users and for admin.
2. Individual reports can be made to show weekly arrival and depart time. And the average.
3. You can show the user when they are late.
5. Add a points system for users who arrive before a specific time.
6. Disallow clocking and clockout outside certain times.
7. For the admin, you can provide daily reports of late employees and an overall view of attendance for all employees on a daily basis.
8. Smart employees can share passwords and help each other login and out even when they are not at the premises. You can maybe send smses with codes which people need to provide before a certain time to show they have arrived.
9 You could also add a finger print scanner to act as the login button to deal with such cases.

== Note:: Didn't have enough time to prepare my application. Started my preparation on 3rd November so i haven't had time to include some features. If  there is a provision for a time extension, I would gladly do this, but they say, DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT, so this will be it for now. Looking forward to hearing from you.===
